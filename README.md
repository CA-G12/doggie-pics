- [Figma Design](<https://www.figma.com/file/3suG0keFcezPo595Kwae2p/Untitled?node-id=0%3A1>)

## âœ§ How to install the project on your local machine.

- You can click the _code_ drop-down menu and copy the link to clone the repo.
- Now go to your terminal and type: `git clone <the link here>` and then the repo will be cloned to your local machine.
- By now you have to open your IDE -I recommend VSCode- and open the project.
- In terminal, run the following commands:
    ```cmd
    npm install
    npm run dev
    ```
    you should see a messaage telling you that the server is running on a certain port.
